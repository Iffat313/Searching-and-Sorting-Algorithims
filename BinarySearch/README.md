In this algorithim, we search for the key in our array by breaking it in half. The, no pun intneded, key word here is half. As a result, it's not an overstatement to say that binary search is faster than linear search. 
The avg run time complexity is o(log (base 2) n) and the best case run time is O(1) constant. As for the worst case run time, this typically occurs if the element is not found in the list, or generally just takes a long time, it is also o(log (base 2)n).
