The big O notation for insertion sort is the same as bubble sort:

The best time complexity for this algorithm is constant 0(n). This occurs when all of the elements are already sorted and no switching is needed.

Both the Average and Worst time complexity are rated Quadratic 0(n^2). This occurs when half, most, or all of the elements are required to be swapped.

Below are some terms that define the twist I've added within the program:

1.  Class: A class is a object that has properties. The properties in this case are it's members. The members are attributes and methods. Attributes are variables whereas methods are functions. The attributes are typically under a private attribute and functions are under a public atttribute. We can use setters and getters as a means for the user to access data under the private attribute, but at the risk of more syntax.

2. Friend function: A friend function is a nonmember function of the class but must be decalared within the class. It's main perk is that it allows us to access members under any type of attribute. 

3. Dynaimc memory allocation: This means that we changing memory is quite flexbile, especailly during the run time. We use the operators new to execute and delete to remove avoid memory leaks.
