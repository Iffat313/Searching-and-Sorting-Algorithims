# Searching-and-Sorting-Algorithims
In this repository, we will look at various algorithims and how we can search and sort lists (array). We will dive deep into the run times as well.

1. **What is a algorithim?:** An algorithim is a series of steps used to solve a problem or accomplish a task. In this case, the series of steps here are the lines of code. The task here is to either find the element or sort the elements. Always assume that elements are going to be integers. 

2. **What is a recursive algorithim?:** A recursive algorithim is when we solve a bigger (complicated) problem by breaking it down into sub problems. From there, we solve the sub problems by applying the same algorithim to each of the sub problems ultimately solving the bigger problem. Essentially, this is achieved when a function calls itself. You will find this repository implementing a recursive algorithim in the merge sort and quick sort algorithims. However, please note recursive algorithims are implemented in other cases as well. 

3. **What is a run time?:** The run time determines how long an algorithim takes to execute. Specifically, based on the given input size in the algorithim. 

4. **What is Big O notation?:** Big O notation is what allows us to characterize the growth rate for the runtime of a function. Because the grwoth consider's a infinite amount of input, this is how the Big-o notation is able to consider the best and worst time complexity. 

5. **What is Growth Rate?:** Growth rate refers to how quick the runtime increases or decreases as we gradually increase the input size or the value of the input. You can get a clear illustration of this via graphing two or more functions.
