# Searching-and-Sorting-Algorithims
In this repository, we will look at various algorithims and how we can search and sort lists (array). We will dive deep into the run times as well.

1. **What is a algorithim?:** An algorithim is a series of steps used to solve a problem or accomplish a task. In this case, the series of steps here are the lines of code. The task here is to either find the element or sort the elements. Always assume that elements are going to be integers. 

2. **What is a recursive algorithim?:** A recursive algorithim is when we solve a bigger (complicated) problem by breaking it down into sub problems. From there, we solve the sub problems by applying the same algorithim to each of the sub problems ultimately solving the bigger problem. Essentially, this is achieved when a function calls itself. You will find this repository implementing a recursive algorithim in the merge sort and quick sort algorithims. However, please note recursive algorithims are implemented in other cases as well. 

3. **What is a run time?:** The run time determines how long an algorithim takes to execute. Specifically, based on the given input size in the algorithim. 

4. **What is Big O notation?:** Big Oh notation is what allows us to express the run time in a mathmatical way. However, it doesn't look at the input size but rather all cases. It will measure the run time as if the input were gradually increasing!
